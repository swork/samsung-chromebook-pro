Word is a now-unsupported, end-of-life Samsung Chromebook Pro makes a good
full-featured Ubuntu laptop, save only internal audio (BT and USB audio devices
work, just not the internal speakers). I don't need 'em; I do need a decent
native Linux development laptop. This might do.

But finding out is involved. Like, an early step is to disassemble the thing and disable
hardware write protection on the firmware storage, and reflash it to a UEFI BIOS.

Seems like a good project to take systematically, and write up carefully in advance.
